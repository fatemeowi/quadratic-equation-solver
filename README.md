# Quadratic Equation Solver

This is a simple Python project that solves quadratic equations of the form: axÂ² + bx + c = 0. The program calculates the discriminant and finds the real (or complex) roots of the equation.

How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the program in your terminal: python quadratic_solver.py
4. Enter the values of a, b, and c when prompted.
5. The program will display the solutions.

Example:
Enter a: 1
Enter b: -3
Enter c: 2
The solutions are: x1 = 2.0, x2 = 1.0
